This repository demonstrates a common error in Objective-C method swizzling:  failure to handle exceptions and manage memory correctly. The `MethodSwizzlingBug.m` file shows the problematic code. The `MethodSwizzlingSolution.m` file provides a corrected version with improved exception handling and memory management.  This example highlights the importance of robust error handling and memory management techniques when implementing method swizzling in Objective-C applications.
