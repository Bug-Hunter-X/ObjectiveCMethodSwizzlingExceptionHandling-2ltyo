In Objective-C, a subtle error can occur when dealing with method swizzling if you don't handle potential exceptions or edge cases effectively.  For instance, if you attempt to swizzle a method that doesn't exist, or if you encounter an unexpected class structure during runtime, your application might crash or exhibit unpredictable behavior.  Another example is improper handling of retain counts in swizzled methods, potentially leading to memory leaks or crashes.
